# Information

Since this project canceled one-sidedly, I think why don't I make this a public project instead. You can learn from it, maybe you inspired by it, just credited me if you like, if you don't like it, it's okay too. I know the design is very old school, but what can I do, I'm just doing what they want (at least that's how it work in my country).
